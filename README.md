    <b>Citinary </b>
</p>

We are a group of 4 engineering students with a passion for IA, machine learning overhaul, software development and we love discovering unusal locations. Please note that the Citinary project is still under development.

Citinary started as an engineering school project and aims at providing a way for tourists to have a personalized and digitalized buttler that will assist them during their journey throught the magnificent city that is Paris, the city we will focus our efforts on in the short-term before thinking about expansion.

This repository contains the source code of the citinary mobile app that has been developped in React Native coupled with expo. We are currently working on the implementation of machine learning models (TF lite) to proces the wishes of the people using the app. We will be using Firebase to store the data regarding the different locations, the itinaries and users profiles. Concerning our data privacy policy, we will have an option for you to "flush" all the private data we have on you so that you won't have to worry about their usage.
